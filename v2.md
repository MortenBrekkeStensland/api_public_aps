<!-- TODO: check supported version -->
## APS API v2 (APS v3.1.0 and above) 


### Protocol:
APS has a TCP server that waits for a client connection on a default port (31600) and can be configured from the app settings. Once a connection is instantiated between the client and APS it will continuously listen to the incoming messages from that client.
Starting from API v2, APS uses length-prefixed messages approach for sent/received messages instead of termination char `$`.

For sending commands
1. Prepare the command as JSON string.
2. Calculate the length of the entire message.
3. Send the length of the entire message in 4 bytes big-endian.
4. Send the JSON string message.

First command you should send is the API version that you want to use, otherwise, v1 comunication protocol will be assumed.
```JSON
{
   "command": "api_version", 
   "api_version": 2
}
```
APS also will send the API version once the connection instantiated
```JSON
{
   "action": "api_version", 
   "api_version": 2
}
```
**Notes**

1. All the above messages are length-prefixed.
2. For backward compatibility APS will send a `$` after the above api_version message, because clients targetting v1 are still expecting `$` char to split messages on, you just need to ignore this message, it may be removed after dropping v1 support.
3. The `$` mentioned in note #2 is also length-prefixed
